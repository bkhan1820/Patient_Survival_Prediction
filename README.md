# Patient_Survival_Prediction


## About The Project

For this collaborative project conducted with Aleksandra Bundovska, Yang Bai, we decided to use the data set "Patient_survival_prediction" found on <ins>[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient)</ins>. This data is initially from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative and was collected in USA, in 2021. It contains information about patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

This data set has 91713 observations and 85 variables.
There are various factors given, which are involved when a patient is hospitalized. We aim to analyse which factors have an influence on patient's survival rate during hospitalization. Moreover on the basis of these factors, we will try to predict patient survival during hospitalization.


In this article, the steps are followed as below:

1. Data preperation, you can find the R script <ins>[here](https://github.com/bkhan1820/Patient_Survival_Prediction/blob/main/Data%20Preperation%20Patient_Survival.R)</ins>
2. Data Visualisation, R script <ins>[here](https://github.com/bkhan1820/Patient_Survival_Prediction/blob/main/Data%20Visualisation%20Patient_Survival.R)</ins>
3. Model Fitting and Cross Validation
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine 
6. Neural networks
